For the distribution of non-defaulters, each score \"s\" is plotted versus the proportion of non-defaulters with score lesser than or equal to  \"s\" or \"False Alarm\". The statistic of interest is called the KS statistic and is the maximum difference between these two distributions. The score at which this maximum is attained is also of interest.
